# Contributing

So this project was created to fix a very specific problem I was having with my home setup, but at the same time I figured there's a chance this project might be interesting to some.

If that's the case, and you are interested in contributing in some small way feel free to open an issue or even better send a pull request against the dev branch.

**Pull Requests**
Please only submit pull requests against the dev branch. assuming the image builds and nothing bad happens in testing I'll merge dev with master periodically.
